# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of simple Python projects!  
This repo is meant to track my learning progress, experiment with ideas, and build a solid foundation with Python.

## Projects

### 1. Project 1 â€“ Guess the Number ðŸŽ¯
A simple Python program where the computer picks a random number and the user tries to guess it.

### 2. Project 2 â€“ Dice Game ðŸŽ²
A turn-based dice game for 2 to 4 players.  
Each player takes turns rolling a 6-sided die and tries to reach 50 points.  
- Rolling a 1 ends the player's turn and resets the turn score to 0.  
- Rolling any other number adds to the turn score.  
- Players can choose to continue rolling or hold and keep their score.  
- First player to reach or exceed 50 total points wins.

## How to Run
